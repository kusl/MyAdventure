I have added a dump.txt here from an existing avalonia ui application to jump start the process but really I have no code at all at this point. 
We will need to start from scratch. 
The point of this application is to create an idle/clicker game. 
It is a clone of Adventure Capitalist with polished UI, big, bold colored animated buttons, and a game with rich progression and almost infinite customizability. 
While we can't implement everything in adventure capitalist, 
lets try our best and please give me everything including github actions, keystore information, everything. 
For the first prompt, you will need to generate me a shell script that sets up this whole thing 
the dump.txt and output.txt  in your project files is supposed to be a guide but you don't need to follow it exactly. 
that is from a different game and we want to follow industry and engineering best practices, 
not the same potholes we fell into before 
the github actions should create a new binary every time we push new code to the main branch 
for the first prompt, I will need a shell script because there are entirely too many files to copy by hand 
but subsequently unless there is a lot of files to copy paste, I would prefer to get full files to copy paste. 
if there are too many files that change, please give me a bash script that truncates the existing files and adds the new files in its place 
we have git for version control so we should be good there. 
use central package management
use the latest dotnet and c sharp features such as primary constructors, records, and so on 
research and use intuitive UI elements with huge buttons 
and responsive ui 
we should never ever have a scroll bar anywhere. everything must fit in the view, whether it is a small display or a big display 
use dependency injection and app settings json and so on to store variables such as application name 
I would like to see localization and internationalization as well if possible 
remember the instructions 
```
I want to learn Avalonia UI to write high performance cross platform free of cost. 
I want to use the latest and greatest technology. 
I want this to serve as a sample as well as a starting point for native applications. 
It should be easy to use the latest dotnet technology 
such as slnx files, props files, and so on. 
Where possible, we should use long term sustainable technology such as sqlite and postgresql. 
We should avoid any nuget package that requires payment of money, free of cost for non-commercial software is not enough. 
We ourselves should not charge any money, ever. 
We should have extensive logging, metrics, etc using open telemetry. 
Application should be built from the ground up to be testable.
All tests including Unit tests, integration tests should be automated and be performant so we can run them after every change. 
The whole thing should fit in a single git repository. 

Do not generate multiple `slnx` for desktop and android etc no matter how tempting it feels. 
do not generate `build-desktop.sh` and `build-android.sh` scripts to silo the different teams. 
do not attempt to silo different teams at all. 
this is a cross functional team and everyone can work with all parts of the code. 
especially with claude opus 4.5 (or later) 
there is no excuse to silo people like this 
we should fix things properly, not put bandaid on problems by separating desktop and android teams 
if the build is slow, 
everyone should suffer 
not because we are masochists 
but because we want everyone to know when stuff is broken 
so it gets fixed as quickly as possible.
